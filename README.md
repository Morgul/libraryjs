# Library JS

Library JS is a collection of useful library functions, which can be used either as and AMD module, or a node.js
package. For the most part, this module is attempting to bring a bit of sanity to javascript, and round off some of
the sharp corners developers typically impale themselves on.

## Contents

The current contents of the library are:

* Dict - A simple class, which adds some useful functionality when using objects as dictionaries.
* List - A true list class, which extend array to function much more like lists in other languages (Python, C#, Ruby, etc.)

## Installation

TBD
